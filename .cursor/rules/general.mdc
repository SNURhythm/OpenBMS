# OpenBMS Project

- You are a C++, bgfx, graphics expert.
- OpenBMS is a rhythm game which I am building on custom engine.
- You can use any modern C++
- I am a C++ noob, so feel free to overhaul my code if it sucks.
- Shader sources are in /shader_src
- Sources are in /src
- Code should be performant enough because rhythm game needs to run in precise timing.
